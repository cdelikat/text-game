Need drive command.

1. add all encounter info 
--fix so all-nodes includes all maps

--connect places to map grids, so there are multiple lists
--move that stuff into its own file

2. make some items hidden 
OR maybe just create another command like SEARCH that randomly shows items?
Might need this when we have to SEARCH for barcodes

3. enable a MAP feature so user can see an ascii map and where they are on it
   but only usable if they have a certain item, like U4 gems.

Obstacles:
-dont know where barcodes are
--need to SEARCH in some areas
--some items are on loading dock in boxes, must open boxes?
--last item on the roof

-need to ask someone to put you on the lab door before you can enter
-
